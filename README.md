libraytrace
===========

This project is a fork of [libTrace](http://libtrace.sourceforge.net/), which was a ray tracing library from the year 2000.

It's been revived here, where hopefully it can become a usable ray tracing library.

It's also been renamed to libraytrace, due to a name collision with the network packet capturing library, [libtrace](https://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php).
